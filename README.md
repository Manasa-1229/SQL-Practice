# SQL Practice

Welcome to my SQL Practice repository! This space is dedicated to those looking to improve their SQL skills through practical exercises. Whether you're a beginner just starting out, an intermediate looking to sharpen your skills, or an advanced user seeking to challenge yourself, there's something here for you.

## About

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the cornerstone of data analysis, allowing users to query and manipulate databases in myriad ways. This repository contains a collection of SQL exercises designed to cover a wide range of topics and difficulties.

The exercises are divided into categories based on complexity and topics, such as joins, aggregation functions, subqueries, and more. Each exercise comes with a detailed description, and while solutions are provided, I encourage you to try solving the exercises on your own to get the most out of your learning experience.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the exercises, make sure you have access to an SQL environment. This can be a local database setup like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, or an online SQL playground such as [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/) or [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/).
